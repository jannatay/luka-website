# DISNEY – THE GREAT STORYTELLER 
Walt Disney Company (DIS.N, Market Capitalisation $239.73B)1  is a global mass-media and entertainment powerhouse with strong brand equity and wide familiarity amongst consumers. The conglomerate reports through four business segments.

Media Networks - earns affiliate fees for Disney TV content, such as Disney Channel and ABC.

Studio Entertainment – the feature content creation arm which earns revenue through box office sales and licensing.

Parks, Experiences, & Consumer Products – merchandising and theme parks, cruise ships, and other such attractions.

Direct to Consumer & International – streaming (Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+) and international media (Hotstar).



Disney is fundamentally a great branded storyteller. The company’s business model revolves around leveraging its IP to drive revenue through the “Disney ecosystem” of integrated business segments. Disney is now in a transition period as it works to align the company’s business model to the consumer shift away from the cable-TV model towards OTT media consumption. 2

We believe that the transition will be successful and result in substantial wealth creation for those with patience to hold this blue-chip stock the long-term.



STOCK UP 10% AFTER YEARS OF CORD CUTTING  

Image result for national geographic logoOver the ten years from 2008 to 2018 Disney grew revenue at a CAGR of 4.6%, operating income at a CAGR of 6.4%, and free cash flow at a CAGR of 9.0%.  In light of the ever increasing pace of the cord-cutting trend,3 the market has focused on stagnation in the company’s Media Networks segment which accounted for 41% of FY2018 revenue.

The market’s single-issue focus was reflected in August 2015 when the stock dropped over 9.2% the day after it was first revealed there were “modest sub-losses” in its cable TV sports division, ESPN.4  When Disney revealed its plans to develop a streaming platform at its Investor’s Day on April 12 the company’s shares jumped over 10% on the news.5  















DISNEY RECIPE TRANSCENDS CORD-CUTTING

Disney’s business model is not “not wedded to the [linear media] distribution model, what [it is] wedded to is creating great content that is branded.” 6  In the 1950’s Walt and Roy Disney, then leading the company, leveraged success in film creation to launch a channel on TV and drive business to the company´s first theme park in Anaheim, California. They formed a business model based on leveraging their central asset, creative storytelling talent, to infuse value into a diverse array of entertainment assets which all feed of each other.

While the company’s portfolio of assets has changed significantly, the fundamental proposition has remained the same. The company has successfully built on this ecosystem over decades and compounded success in branded content creation to gain deep familiarity with consumers. This integrated business model and strong brand equity provides the company with a wide economic moat which will ensure it thrives in the next generation of media consumption. This is not a business which can easily be replicated.



“No matter how much the marketplace is disrupted … a great story well told is going to succeed as an investment, as a financial proposition” – Bob Iger, CEO8





FOX ACQUISTION – CONTENT IS KING

Clarity of what the company’s business model rests on empowers its management to navigate a shifting strategic terrain over the long term.  This has allowed CEO Robert Iger to acquire studio assets which vastly expanded and diversified Disney’s IP portfolio, and predictably generated value for the business post-acquisition. The most recent and largest acquisition, of Twenty First Century Fox, gives the company access to a major film studio that will contribute strongly to Disney’s IP library. Not only will cost synergies between the studios be exploited but the Fox IP will give a large boost to the Disney ecosystem; from attractions in its theme parks to merchandising.



DIRECT TO CONSUMER – DISNEY+

On April 12 Disney laid out its plans for launching and growing a major streaming platform, Disney+. The platform will launch on November 12 at an aggressive price of USD $6.99 per month, or $69.99 per year. This is considerably lower than Netflix’s $12.99 per month standard plan and still cheaper than its $8.99 per month basic plan.



With a forecasted range of 60m to 90m subscribers by FY2024 this implies annual revenue of $5.03B to $7.55B from the Disney+, assuming all subscribers are month to month. Adding on Hulu’s estimated range of 40m to 60m subscribers and ESPN+ estimate of 8m subscribers, at current prices this implies revenue of $8.37B to $12.33B in FY2024 for the new Direct to Consumer & International segment.9



This is very short of the $24.5B in revenue brought in by the Media Networks segment in FY2018 which accounted for 41% of the company’s total sales that year. The transition away from cable TV to streaming will be painful in the near term. The projected costs reflect this with the new segment not expected to be profitable until FY2024. The rollout of Disney+ will not only cost money as original content is created and added - but Disney is also going to cost itself the recurring licensing revenues it used to enjoy from having its content on other streaming providers, notably Netflix.



“PLATFORM ECONOMICS TRUMP LICENSING FEES”10

Disney is giving up on easy cash flows and tolerating operational losses in the new segment over the medium-term for the long-term boon of having a closer relationship with its end customers. The streaming bet could not be a clearer alignment with the company’s core business model. Disney+ won’t just be a Netflix that has thousands of hours of Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Fox, and Disney content. It will be an Amazon for Marvel action figures with Groupon deals for Star Wars roller-coasters and rooms at Disney hotels.11



“No matter how much technology changes….how people get their stories, we’re still going to be relevant but only if we enable ourselves to be distributed and purchased by the consumer in a modern way, if we stick to the old that would be a recipe for extinction.” – Robert Iger, CEO12



NOT A ZERO SUM GAME

Competing in the streaming market is not a zero-sum game. Deloitte estimates that streaming subscribers average three OTT subscriptions per head in the US.13 Disney isn’t seeking to dominate Netflix and catch up to its 139m subscribers.14  With a low-price market entry strategy for Disney+  the company is betting on generating meaningful scale in the short-term by co-existing with the incumbent juggernaut Netflix as a “must have” add-on.  We are confident the company will quickly pick a lot of low-hanging fruit with appeal to families and its large library of content in demand with a large swathe of people. Disney has scale and market penetration in its other segments to leverage and achieve its targeted 60m to 90m subscribers if management plays its cards right





“There’s clearly room for two or three global providers in this space…I think Netflix will be very successful and I think Amazon obviously is going to be very successful and the question is who is going to be number three…I expect it to be Disney.”  
- John Malone15



















NOT JUST A MEDIA COMPANY

Disney does have two segments other than Media Networks that accounted for 51% of revenue in FY2018 which haven’t been getting much attention from market commentary in the backdrop of cord-cutting fears despite growing revenue and expanding margins

Studio Entertainment is the core driver of Disney’s ecosystem. Disney produced seven of the highest grossing films in the ten years preceding 2019,16 and six of the highest grossing films of all time.17 The Fox acquisition expanded the pipeline dramatically with the film slate for 2019 being increased from six releases to fourteen.18

Successful releases from the Studio Entertainment business drive revenue for the Parks, Experiences, and Consumer Products segment, which in turn entrenches consumer familiarity with Disney’s brands. With the greater data Disney will gather on its customers through a direct relationship at the point of consumption it will be able to optimise offerings in its Parks, Experiences, and Consumer Products business, and focus its content creation in the Studio Entertainment segment.



SUMMARY

As long-term investors we believe the market is failing to see the forest through the trees. Disney’s business model is not dependent on traditional media distribution. We believe the company is well placed to develop a meaningful market presence in streaming due to its strong brand equity, scale, and rich history in creating popular branded content.

Further, should its proprietary streaming services fail to sustain a meaningful presence in the new media landscape Disney’s model remains sound as the company can revert to licensing its content to other distributors. We are confident, however, in management’s ability to transition to streaming and that Robert Iger’s successor will reap the benefits of the bet on having a direct relationship with consumers.





We estimated a conservative Intrinsic Value range by conducting a sum-of-the-parts valuation using segment peer group EBITDA multiples and applying an 8x EV/Sales19 multiple to forecasted revenues from Direct to Consumer assuming fixed prices. From Elevation Capital’s average cost price of USD $109.90 this implies an upside range from:



~+10% assuming the lower end of the forecasted streaming subscriber numbers is reached; to



~+35% assuming the upper end of the forecasted streaming subscriber numbers is reached.
